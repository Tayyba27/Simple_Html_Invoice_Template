# How to use
Open the invoice.html file and use its HTML and CSS in your application.


# Printer-friendly styling
By default, the appearance of the invoice when printed is the same as when viewed on a screen. If the invoice is the primary or only element on the page, you may want to consider removing the box-shadow and border, and letting the invoice extend the full width of the page. That can be accomplished with this CSS:

@media print {
  .invoice-box {
    max-width: unset;
    box-shadow: none;
    border: 0px;
  }
}
